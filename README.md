Hi, I'm Dhruv Chauhan 👋

I am a B.Tech Computer Science Engineering student at Doon University, Dehradun (Batch 2024–2028).
I focus on building strong fundamentals in programming and applying my skills through real-world projects,
especially in artificial intelligence and computer vision.

I have hands-on internship experience at DRDO (IRDE – Optical Lab), where I worked on
computer vision-based systems including real-time human detection and laser-assisted
heart targeting prototypes. This experience helped me understand how software,		
hardware, and algorithms come together in practical applications.
